FromScratch
===========

## A simple but smart note-taking app

FromScratch is a little app that you can use as a quick note taking or todo app.</p>

* Small and simple, the only UI is the text you type
* Saves on-the-fly, no need to manually save
* Automatic indenting
* Note-folding
* Use checkboxes to keep track of your TODO's
* Powerful keyboard control
* Replaces common syntax with symbols, such as arrows
* Free
